#### 🚀 About Me
I’m a Front End Web developer who is passionate about making error-free websites with 100% client satisfaction. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. I love to solve real-world problems. I am strategic, goal-oriented, and always work with an end goal in mind. Over the past years, I created 100s of websites for my clients. Most of the time I work with WordPress but some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, JavaScript as well as mongoDB.

Skills: REACT / JS/ mondoDB / HTML / CSS
